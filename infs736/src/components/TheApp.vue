                                The mobile application for the assignment was created as a native android application and was built
                                within Android Studio.  The application was meant to be the start to a potential native replacement
                                for the existing conference application in use by my employer.  The existing application takes
                                advantage of cordova and would show performance improvements if rebuilt natively.
                            </p>

                                The native application constructed displays Online Learning Consortium conference specific
                                information and accepts a user's name and title so as to greet them properly withing the application.
                                If built out fully this would include an authorization system in place of this functionality.
                                Additionally, the main purpose of the application is to consume Rest APIs feeding in
                                conference specific data regarding sessions, speakers, and sponsors.
