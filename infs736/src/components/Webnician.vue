                                EduForum is a next-generation Learning Management system built for everyone! EduForum is under development as an open source project and those needing a platform for creating and running a learning environment should feel free to download and customize as needed. Cloud-based options will also be available upon project completion. EduForum takes advantage of some of the newest web technologies Laravel and Vue.js to make the platform more responsive and user-friendly than some of the more entrenched LMS options.
